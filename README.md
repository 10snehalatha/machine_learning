ML-Based Techniques for Monitoring the Impact of Soil and Water Quality on Nutritional Value of Paddy Crop
Introduction
This project aims to develop machine learning-based algorithms to monitor the impacts of soil and water quality on the nutritional value of paddy crops in urban areas. By integrating data from various sources, including soil samples, water quality measurements, and crop nutrient analysis, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between environmental factors and crop nutrition.

Objectives
To monitor and analyze soil and water quality parameters that impact the nutritional value of paddy crops.
To develop and validate machine learning models to predict the nutritional quality of paddy crops based on soil and water quality data.
To provide actionable insights for farmers, agricultural policymakers, and urban planners for improved agricultural practices and land management.
Key Features
Soil Quality Analysis: Evaluates soil pH, organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and NPK values.
Water Quality Analysis: Assesses water pH, salinity, toxicity, alkalinity, and conductivity.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs) to predict crop nutritional values.
Data Visualization: Presents data through various visualizations like pie charts, box plots, and heat maps for better understanding and interpretation.
